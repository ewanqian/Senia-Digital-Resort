## Project Introduction

Senia Island is a spatial perception experience experimental project under the VIRTURA SpacePort system, a digital resort based on Minecraft.

On the generated island, we designed 4 towns and sightseeing experiences, really operating it like a resort.

Minecraft is a map editing software that allows multiple people to collaborate simultaneously. We are not currently treating it as a serious Web3 project, just enjoying playing this simulation game.
